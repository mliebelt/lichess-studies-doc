# Introduction to Lichess Studies

## What are Lichess Studies?

Lichess Studies are powerful tools on the Lichess chess platform that allow players to analyze, comment on, and share chess games and positions in detail. They provide an interactive environment for learning, teaching, and exploring the game of chess.

Key features of Lichess Studies:
- Creation and organization of chess variations and games
- Adding comments and annotations
- Real-time collaboration with other players
- Sharing studies with the chess community

## Why Use Lichess Studies?

1. **Improve Chess Understanding**: By analyzing games and positions, players can deepen their tactical and strategic understanding.
2. **Effective Learning Tool**: Trainers can create tailored lessons and share them with their students.
3. **Collaboration**: Players can work together on analyses and learn from each other. Collaboration can be synchronous (at the same time), and depending on the roles of the participants, you get different scenarios.
4. **Documentation**: Store your own ideas and insights for future reference. Lichess Studies offer (almost) all the possibilities that large and commercial tools also provide.
5. **Community**: Share your insights with the global chess community and benefit from others' contributions.

Lichess Studies are an indispensable tool for any serious chess player, from beginner to grandmaster.

### Do I need to register with Lichess to use Studies?

It depends on how you want to use them:

* If you want to create studies yourself, you must be registered and logged in. This is simply because the studies are stored online (on Lichess), and you want to be able to find your studies among hundreds of thousands of users.
* If you have references to studies (links for unlisted studies, or the names of public studies), you can do a lot with them. However, making changes is usually not possible without an account.
