# Lichess Studies Documentation

I use studies in Lichess for all my training work, and teach that to our chess organization in Germany (WÃ¼rttemberg) in different courses. Recently I documented a long existing bug (ever used 'Hide next moves', works now as expected). There I have seen that my usage of lichess studies is only a small fraction of what is possible, and that there is no detailed documentation at all available.

Therefore I think I should start doing that. With the help of others, we can make Lichess Studies an even better product.

## How to use it?

You may of course just use the files directly on Github. But the main use of it is having a static web site online all the time.

So go to

* [Lichess Studien](https://lichess-studies-doc.netlify.app/docs/lichess-studies/) The German part of the  documentation. That is my mother tounge, and my other documentation projects are German-only.
* [Lichess Studies](https://lichess-studies-doc.netlify.app/en/docs/lichess-studies/) The corresponding English counterpart. I will try to have them both updated in parallel all the time.

## Other material

If you are interested in the use of Lichess for your chess (training), there are 2 online documentations by myself (in German) available:

* [Schachtraining mit Lichess und Discord](https://schachtraining-lichess-discord.netlify.app/) How to do online training by using Lichess for the chess and training part, and Discord (or other tools) for communication with your training partner?
* [Schach Selbsttraining](https://schach-selbsttraining.netlify.app/) Chess is special, because you can train it on your own. But how to do that? And how can online tools (including Lichess, which takes a big part here) can be used for it.
